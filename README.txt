I developed a simplified YouTube clone using HTML and CSS to replicate the visual elements and layout of YouTube's homepage, aiming to enhance my web design skills and understand UI/UX principles. The project includes a custom header with a logo, search bar, and user icons, a sidebar with navigation links and quick-access categories, and a main content area with a responsive grid displaying video thumbnails, titles, and channel information. Hover effects highlight video thumbnails, enhancing user interaction. The design adapts for various devices using media queries, Flexbox, and Grid for flexible structuring. This project demonstrates my ability to recreate complex web interfaces, showcasing my expertise in front-end development and design. Please note that this clone is created solely for educational purposes and does not include backend functionality or dynamic content.
